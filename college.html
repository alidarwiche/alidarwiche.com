                    <p>My freshmen year of college, I was talking to my friend Ross at this exact spot; right in front of my freshmen dorm. I had just came from my only Friday class, Calculus 1 from 2:30pm - 3:30pm, and was headed back to change into real clothing. This was my usual after-class routine. I was notorious on-campus for longboarding to class in my pajamas or <a href="https://www.pajamasbuy.com/animal-adult-grey-penguin-onesies-hoodie-kigurumi-pajamas/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIie7Lksjz1QIVw7fACh1S2QBmEAQYAyABEgI29vD_BwE">penguin</a>/<a href="http://www.shoppajama.com/adult-onesies/adult-unisex-green-dinosaur-kigurumi-onesie-pajamas-costume?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhoWil8jz1QIVCahpCh3Z0wbcEAQYAiABEgK_jvD_BwE">dinosaur</a> kigurumi.</p>
                    <p>On this day however, I was wearing my favorite combination; my Pac-Man pajamas along with my School of Undergraduate Studies t-shirt. At the University of Texas at Austin, students who do not know which college they want to attend at the University may enroll in the School of Undergraduate studies for two years. This grace period is meant to give students time to discover, experiment, and apply to the many different majors our University offers until they have decided which degree they want to pursue. In this period, the student's major is referred to as undeclared.</p>
                    <p>What's special about this moment though was Ross. In my usual ridiculousness, Ross very lovingly said, "Ali, you're exactly what I picture when I think of an undeclared student." And I very lovingly said, "That's the greatest compliment I've ever heard," and I meant it. When I was applying to college, I knew I was going to be an undeclared student for the first couple years. There just wasn't a single career/major that satisfied all the different things I wanted to learn about: technology, leadership, creativity. I wanted to study all three of these to the same level of knowledge that professionals in these industries would.</p>
                    <p>Since that day, I've become a student with majors and minors in many different things. These majors and minors I've elaborated on down below. But, at heart, I am and will always be an undeclared student; that is my true major. Because to me, an undeclared student studies how to be the best learner at anything. And that's what I came to college for.</p>

            <hr class="divider">
            <p>Creative Writing is the only subject that I 100% knew I would study during my college experience. I've been writing poetry, since 2009. However, it was only after taking my first Creative Writing course at UT Austin that I truly became a poet. In this course, I got to work under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Young_(poet)">Dean Young</a> while he was the Poet Laureate for Texas. Learning under Dean was a life changing experience that I will cherish forever. Below are a few examples of my poetic growth throughout the Creative Writing certificate:</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">But wait, there's more!</h4>
            <p>As an Honors Creative Writing student, I was fortunate enough to complete my own thesis containing a collection of my poetry. This collection is titled "Find Me" and is an exploration of the reader/writer relationship. This exploration follows and is meant to address my own anxiety with the concept of a "reader". Up until this collection, there was no reader involved in my work; only myself. To me, poetry was this safe space where I could experiment with word and sound to discover new ways of portraying emotion. To be honest, it still is. But, for this collection, my experimental thoughts needed to make sense to a reader. In that way I had to satisfy the reader, and that scares me. What is this relationship between the reader and the writer? What is expected of each of us? What is fair?</p>
            <p>I intent to continue growing this collection, and will be avoiding posting it online until it is complete. If you would like to read my collection, send me a private message. <a href="https://twitter.com/Darwiche2005">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darwiche2005/">LinkedIn</a> will work if you do not have my contact info. I would love to hear your thoughts on my work, thus far!</p>

            <p>I've always wanted to sing, but didn't have the courage to begin until Senior year of high school. Now, when I say want... I mean WANT. However, I was an incredibly insecure kid and the fear of being laughed at was immense. When I started school at Cairo American College in 5th grade, I learned about the CAC Vocal CDs that the Choir department released every year. This CD was a collection of choirs and solo acts professionally recorded for the community to hear. From 5th grade till graduation, I bought these CDs and idolized the singers on it. In 10th grade, I started singing the song "Lullabye" by Fall Out Boy just incase a miracle happened and I got the chance to audition for the CD. In 12th grade, that miracle came in the form of courage, hard-work, and the best human ever (Ben Gallego) playing guitar.</p>

            <p>This accomplishment gave me a confidence and drive that I had never experienced before. When I arrived at The University of Texas at Austin. The only thing on my mind was "How can I keep singing?" So, I joined the UT Men's Chorus and became Treasurer of the organization; later Vice-President. I joined the Texas Songhorns, the only all-male A Capella group at UT Austin, and even managed to land a solo! I wrote and produced my first song with the help of my good friend Adam Barrett on guitar. But, my world truly changed when I learned about Non-Major's voice lessons and begun private instructions with Masters and Doctoral Opera students.</p>
